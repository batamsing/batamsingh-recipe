## About the Project
This is a simple react project. A food recipe app that allows users to search for and save their favorite recipes. The user can view detailed information about the meal recipe ingredients. And also user can add their recipe as their favorites.

This app was created using HTML, Javascript (specifically utilizing ReactJS). And, for styling, I used Tailwindcss.

In this project I added seven pages (home, search, meal, about, contact, details and favorites). I also used the concept of React Context for state management.
In addition to this, I also created a responsive design for smaller screen.

## About the data
The data used in this project is from The Meal DB (https://www.themealdb.com/). It contains information about various meals including their names, ingredients and instructions on how to prepare source used in the project.
